# Kick Comments API

## Object

This project is aiming to implement a kickstarter comment search engine. Currently kickstarter comments cannot be searched at all which makes it hard to follow conversations or replies, particularly when new comments are being created at a rapid rate.

## Solution

* Implement an API that can scrape all of the comments for a particular project
* Provide the ability to search through these comments using a given keyword or username

Finally a basic front end UI will need to be built to facilitate searching. This will be done under a separate repo once the API is built.
